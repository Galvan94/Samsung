## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

***ucidataset*** <- folder includes all the data files

***CodeBook.md*** <- file includes the description from all the variables and process of transforming data

***run_analysis.r*** <- The most important file to get the note, includes the getting, cleaning and processing data script

***finalData.txt*** <- file includes all the observations with tidy data and the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Following the steps:

#### You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
